7:T468,For a graph $G$, we denote by $\alpha(G)$ the size of a maximum independent set and by $\omega(G)$ the size of a maximum clique in $G$. Our paper lies on the edge of two lines of research, related to $\alpha$ and $\omega$, respectively. One of them studies $\alpha$-variants of graph parameters, such as $\alpha$-treewidth or $\alpha$-degeneracy. The second line deals with graph classes where some parameters are bounded by a function of $\omega(G)$. A famous example of this type is the family of $\chi$-bounded classes, where the chromatic number $\chi(G)$ is bounded by a function of $\omega(G)$.
      
      A Ramsey-type argument implies that if the $\alpha$-variant of a graph parameter $\rho$ is bounded by a constant in a class $\mathcal{G}$, then $\rho$ is bounded by a function of $\omega$ in $\mathcal{G}$. If the reverse implication also holds, we say that $\rho$ is awesome. Otherwise, we say that $\rho$ is awful. In the present paper, we identify a number of awesome and awful graph parameters, derive some algorithmic applications of awesomeness, and propose a number of open problems related to these notions.8:T601,@misc{BDLSZ2025,

}9:T484,The $H$-Induced Minor Containment problem ($H$-IMC) consists in deciding if a fixed graph $H$ is an induced minor of a graph $G$ given as input, that is, whether $H$ can be obtained from $G$ by deleting vertices and contracting edges. Equivalently, the problem asks if there exists an induced minor model of $H$ in $G$, that is, a collection of disjoint subsets of vertices of $G$, each inducing a connected subgraph, such that contracting each subgraph into a single vertex results in $H$.
      
It is known that $H$-IMC is NP-complete for several graphs $H$, even when $H$ is a tree. In this work, we investigate which properties of $H$ guarantee the existence of an induced minor model whose structure can be leveraged to solve the problem in polynomial time. This allows us to identify four infinite families of graphs $H$ that enjoy such properties. Moreover, we show that if the input graph $G$ excludes long induced paths, then $H$-IMC is polynomial-time solvable for any fixed graph $H$. As a byproduct of our results, this implies that $H$-IMC is polynomial-time solvable for all graphs $H$ with at most $5$ vertices, except for three open cases.a:T644,@misc{DDHP2025II,

}b:T52c,We consider the task of allocating indivisible items to agents, when the agents’ preferences over the items are identical. The preferences are captured by means of a directed acyclic graph, with vertices representing items and an edge $(a,b)$, meaning that each of the agents prefers item $a$ over item $b$. The dissatisfaction of an agent is measured by the number of items that the agent does not receive and for which it also does not receive any more preferred item. The aim is to allocate the items to the agents in a fair way, i.e., to minimize the maximum dissatisfaction among the agents. We study the status of computational complexity of that problem and establish the following dichotomy: the problem is NP-hard for the case of at least three agents, even on fairly restricted graphs, but polynomially solvable for two agents. We also provide several polynomial-time results with respect to different underlying graph structures, such as graphs of width at most two and tree-like structures such as stars and matchings. These findings are complemented with fixed parameter tractability results related to path modules and independent set modules.

}d:T719,The independence number of a tree decomposition is the maximum of the independence numbers of the subgraphs induced by its bags. The tree-independence number of a graph is the minimum independence number of a tree decomposition of it. Several NP-hard graph problems, like maximum weight independent set, can be solved in time $n^{mathcal{O}(k)})$ if the input $n$-vertex graph is given together with a tree decomposition of independence number $k$ . Yolov, in [SODA 2018], gave an algorithm that, given an $n$-vertex graph $G$ and an integer $k$, in time $n^{mathcal{O}(k^{3})}$ either constructs a tree decomposition of $G$ whose independence number is $mathcal{O}(k^{3})$ or correctly reports that the tree-independence number of $G$ is larger than $k$. In this paper, we first give an algorithm for computing the tree-independence number with a better approximation ratio and running time and then prove that our algorithm is, in some sense, the best one can hope for. More precisely, our algorithm runs in time $2^{mathcal{O}(k^{2})}n^{mathcal{O}(k)}$ and either outputs a tree decomposition of $G$ with independence number at most $8k$, or determines that the tree-independence number of $G$ is larger than $k$. This implies $2^{mathcal{O}(k^{2})}n^{mathcal{O}(k)}$-time algorithms for various problems, like maximum weight independent set, parameterized by the tree-independence number $k$ without needing the decomposition as an input. Assuming Gap-ETH, an $n^{Omega(k)}$ factor in the running time is unavoidable for any approximation algorithm for the tree-independence number.

In particular, we provide a number of results bounding these parameters on geometric intersection graphs. For example, we show that the layered tree-independence number is $\mathcal{O}(g)$ for $g$-map graphs, $\mathcal{O}(\frac{r}{\tanh r})$ for hyperbolic uniform disk graphs with radius $r$, and $\mathcal{O}(1)$ for spherical uniform disk graphs with radius $r$. Our structural results have algorithmic consequences. In particular, we obtain a number of subexponential or quasi-polynomial-time algorithms for weighted problems such as \textsc{Max Weight Independent Set} and \textsc{Min Weight Feedback Vertex Set} on several geometric intersection graphs.

Equivalently, $H$ is an induced minor of $G$ if there exists an \emph{induced minor model} of $H$ in $G$, that is, a collection of pairwise disjoint subsets of vertices of $G$ labeled by the vertices of $H$, each inducing a connected subgraph in $G$, such that two vertices of $H$ are adjacent if and only if there is an edge in $G$ between the corresponding subsets.

In this paper, we investigate structural properties of induced minor models, including bounds on treewidth and chromatic number of the subgraphs induced by minimal induced minor models.
It is known that for some graphs $H$, testing a given graph $G$ contains $H$ as an induced minor is an NP-complete problem.
Nevertheless, as algorithmic applications of our structural results, we make use of recent developments regarding tree-independence number to show that if $H$ is the $4$-wheel, the $5$-vertex complete graph minus an edge, or a complete bipartite graph $K_{2,q}$, then there is a polynomial-time algorithm to find in a given graph $G$ an induced minor model of $H$ in $G$, if there is one.
We also develop an alternative polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing graphs that do not contain $K_{2,3}$ as an induced minor, which revolves around the idea of detecting the induced subgraphs whose presence is forced when the input graph contains $K_{2,3}$ as an induced minor, using the so-called shortest path detector.

frequently studied discrete optimization problem. In the
setting considered in this work, the agents&#39;
preferences over the items are assumed to be identical. We
consider a very recent measure for the overall quality of
an allocation which does not rely on numerical valuations
of the items. Instead, it captures the agents&#39; opinion
by a directed acyclic preference graph with vertices
representing items. An arc $(a,b)$ in such a graph means
that the agents prefer item $a$ over item $b$. For a given
allocation of items the dissatisfaction of an agent is
defined as the number of items which the agent does not
receive and for which no more preferred item is given to
the agent. Our goal is to find an efficient allocation of
the items to the agents such that the total dissatisfaction
over all agents is minimized. We explore the dichotomy
between NP-hard and polynomially solvable instances,
depending on properties of the underlying preference graph.
While the problem is NP-hard already for three agents even
on very restricted graph classes, it is polynomially
solvable for two agents on general preference graphs. For
an arbitrary number of agents, we derive polynomial-time
algorithms for relevant restrictions of the underlying
undirected graph. These are trees and, among the graphs of

for pickup-delivery requests, such as time windows and ride
time constraints. Given a tour as a sequence of pickups and
deliveries, there exist polynomial time algorithms to find
a schedule respecting these constraints (provided that
there exists one). However, if no such schedule exists, it
is natural to ask for a schedule minimising constraint
violations. We model a generic fixed-sequence scheduling
problem, which we call Min Pickup-Delivery Scheduling, that
allows violation of time window constraints (by late
visits) and ride time constraints, both penalised with
linear penalty functions. Although our model only considers
these two types of time constraints, we show that it can
express other common time constraints such as earliness and
waiting times. We prove that Min Pickup-Delivery Scheduling
is APX-hard, even in the very restrictive case where only
the ride time constraints can be violated and the time
windows have the same length. Conversely, when only the
time window constraints can be violated (by late visits),
we present a polynomial time algorithm to solve the

structural properties and present two polynomial-time

of very different families of graph classes, including

problems, it is an interesting open problem to which extent
$(tw,\omega)$-boundedness has useful algorithmic

sufficient condition for $(tw,\omega)$-bounded graph
classes to admit a polynomial-time algorithm for the
Maximum Weight Independent Packing problem and, as a
consequence, for the weighted variants of the Independent
Set and Induced Matching problems.

Our approach is based on a new min-max graph parameter
related to tree decompositions. We define the
\emph{independence number} of a tree decomposition
$\mathcal{T}$ of a graph as the maximum independence number
over all subgraphs of $G$ induced by some bag of
$\mathcal{T}$. The \emph{tree-independence number} of a
graph $G$ is then defined as the minimum independence
number over all tree decompositions of $G$. Boundedness of
the tree-independence number is a refinement of
$(tw,\omega)$-boundedness that is still general enough to
hold for all the aforementioned families of graph classes.
Generalizing a result on chordal graphs due to Cameron and
Hell from 2006, we show that if a graph is given together
with a tree decomposition with bounded independence number,
then the Maximum Weight Independent Packing problem can be
solved in polynomial time. Applications of our general
algorithmic result to specific graph classes are given in
the third paper of the series [Dallard, Milanič, and

Our approach is based on a new min-max graph parameter
related to tree decompositions. We define the
\emph{independence number} of a tree decomposition
$\mathcal{T}$ of a graph as the maximum independence number
over all subgraphs of $G$ induced by some bag of
$\mathcal{T}$. The \emph{tree-independence number} of a
graph $G$ is then defined as the minimum independence
number over all tree decompositions of $G$. Boundedness of
the tree-independence number is a refinement of
$(tw,\omega)$-boundedness that is still general enough to
hold for all the aforementioned families of graph classes.
Generalizing a result on chordal graphs due to Cameron and
Hell from 2006, we show that if a graph is given together
with a tree decomposition with bounded independence number,
then the Maximum Weight Independent Packing problem can be
solved in polynomial time. Applications of our general
algorithmic result to specific graph classes are given in
the third paper of the series [Dallard, Milanič, and
Štorgel, Treewidth versus clique number. {III}.

structure} in an undirected graph is a partition of its
vertex set into $k$ sets called \textit{communities}, each
of size at least two, such that every vertex of the graph
has proportionally at least as many neighbours in its own
community as in any other community. In this paper, we give
a necessary and sufficient condition for a forest on $n$
vertices to admit a $k$-community structure. Furthermore,
we provide an $\mathcal{O}(n^{2})$-time algorithm that
computes such a $k$-community structure in a forest, if it

show that if communities are allowed to have size one, then
every forest with $n \geq k\geq 2$ vertices admits a
$k$-community structure that can be found in time
$\mathcal{O}(n^{2})$. We then consider threshold graphs and
show that every connected threshold graph admits a

to a star; also if such a $2$-community structure exists,
we explain how to obtain it in linear time. We further
describe two infinite families of disconnected threshold

size $k \geq 1$. The goal is to determine whether there
exists a sequence of $k$-sized independent sets in $G$,
$\langle S_0, S_1, \ldots, S_\ell \rangle$, such that for
every $i$, $|S_i| = k$, $S_i$ is an independent set, $S =
S_0$, $S_\ell = T$, and $|S_i \Delta S_{i+1}| = 2$. In
other words, if we view each independent set as a
collection of tokens placed on a subset of the vertices of
$G$, then the problem asks for a sequence of independent
sets which transforms $S$ to $T$ by individual token jumps
which maintain the independence of the sets. This problem
is known to be PSPACE-complete on very restricted graph
classes, e.g., planar bounded degree graphs and graphs of
bounded bandwidth. A closely related problem is the Token
Sliding problem, where instead of allowing a token to jump
to any vertex of the graph we instead require that a token
slides along an edge of the graph. Token Sliding is also
known to be PSPACE-complete on the aforementioned graph
classes. We investigate the parameterized complexity of
both problems on several graph classes, focusing on the
effect of excluding certain cycles from the input graph. In
particular, we show that both Token Sliding and Token
Jumping are fixed-parameter tractable on $C_4$-free
bipartite graphs when parameterized by $k$. For Token
Jumping, we in fact show that the problem admits a
polynomial kernel on $\{C_3,C_4\}$-free graphs. In the case
of Token Sliding, we also show that the problem admits a
polynomial kernel on bipartite graphs of bounded degree. We
believe both of these results to be of independent
interest. We complement these positive results by showing
that, for any constant $p \geq 4$, both problems are
W[1]-hard on $\{C_4, \dots, C_p\}$-free graphs and Token
Sliding remains W[1]-hard even on bipartite graphs.34:Ta30,@article{BBDLM_ALGORITHMICA2021,

other words, if we view each independent set as a
collection of tokens placed on a subset of the vertices of
$G$, then the problem asks for a sequence of independent
sets which transforms $S$ to $T$ by individual token jumps
which maintain the independence of the sets. This problem
is known to be PSPACE-complete on very restricted graph
classes, e.g., planar bounded degree graphs and graphs of
bounded bandwidth. A closely related problem is the Token
Sliding problem, where instead of allowing a token to jump
to any vertex of the graph we instead require that a token
slides along an edge of the graph. Token Sliding is also
known to be PSPACE-complete on the aforementioned graph
classes. We investigate the parameterized complexity of
both problems on several graph classes, focusing on the
effect of excluding certain cycles from the input graph. In
particular, we show that both Token Sliding and Token
Jumping are fixed-parameter tractable on $C_4$-free
bipartite graphs when parameterized by $k$. For Token
Jumping, we in fact show that the problem admits a
polynomial kernel on $\{C_3,C_4\}$-free graphs. In the case
of Token Sliding, we also show that the problem admits a
polynomial kernel on bipartite graphs of bounded degree. We
believe both of these results to be of independent
interest. We complement these positive results by showing
that, for any constant $p \geq 4$, both problems are

to be \emph{colourful} if all its vertices have different
colours, and a graph is colourful if all its connected
components are colourful. Given a vertex-coloured graph,
the \textsc{Colourful Components} problem asks whether
there exist at most $p$ edges whose removal makes the graph
colourful, and the \textsc{Colourful Partition} problem
asks whether there exists a partition of the vertex set
with at most $p$ parts such that each part induces a
colourful component. We study the problems on
$k$-caterpillars (caterpillars with hairs of length at most
$k$) and explore the boundary between polynomial and
NP-complete cases. It is known that the problems are
NP-complete on $2$-caterpillars with unbounded maximum
degree. We prove that both problems remain NP-complete on
binary $4$-caterpillars and on ternary $3$-caterpillars.
This answers an open question regarding the complexity of
the problems on trees with maximum degree at most $5$. On
the positive side, we give a linear time algorithm for
$1$-caterpillars with unbounded degree, even if the
backbone is a cycle, which outperforms the previous best
complexity for paths and widens the class of graphs.

Moreover, we show that if the input graph $G$ excludes long induced paths, then $H$-IMC is polynomial-time solvable for any fixed graph $H$.

The problem consists in finding a\ncollection of disjoint cycles and paths covering a\nparticular graph called the “scaffold graph”. We\nexamine the difficulty and the approximability of the\nscaffolding problem in special classes of graphs, either\nclose to trees, or very dense. We propose negative and\npositive results, exploring the frontier between difficulty\nand tractability of computing and/or approximating a\nsolution to the problem. Also, we explore a new direction\nthrough related problems consisting in finding a family of\nedges having a strong effect on solution weight.","bibtex":"$3e"},{"key":"DWCG_COCOA2016","type":"inproceedings","title":"Instance Guaranteed Ratio on Greedy Heuristic for Genome Scaffolding.","authors":["Clément Dallard","Mathias Weller","Annie Chateau","Rodolphe Giroudeau"],"year":"2016","booktitle":"Combinatorial optimization and applications","journal":"","publisher":"Springer, Cham","doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-48749-6_22","eprint":"$undefined","url":"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-48749-6_22","abstract":"$3f","bibtex":"$40"}]}]}],["$L41"],"$L42"]}],{},null,false,false]},null,false,false]},null,false,false],"$L43",false]],"m":"$undefined","G":["$44",[]],"S":true}

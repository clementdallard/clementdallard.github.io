  abstract      = {The $H$-Induced Minor Containment problem ($H$-IMC) consists in deciding if a fixed graph $H$ is an induced minor of a graph $G$ given as input, that is, whether $H$ can be obtained from $G$ by deleting vertices and contracting edges. Several graphs $H$ are known for which $H$-IMC is NP-complete, even when $H$ is a tree. In this paper, we investigate which conditions on $H$ and $G$ are sufficient so that the problem becomes polynomial-time solvable. Our results identify three infinite classes of graphs such that, if $H$ belongs to one of these classes, then $H$-IMC can be solved in polynomial time. Moreover, we show that if the input graph $G$ excludes long induced paths, then $H$-IMC is polynomial-time solvable for any fixed graph $H$. As a byproduct of our results, this implies that $H$-IMC is polynomial-time solvable for all graphs $H$ with at most 5 vertices, except for three open cases.},

                   classes defined by finitely many forbidden induced

                   finitely many forbidden induced subgraphs and prove it for
                   the case of graph classes excluding an induced star. We

                   tree-independence number of $P_4$-free graphs, which
                   implies a linear-time algorithm for its computation.

                   preferences over the items are assumed to be identical. We
                   consider a very recent measure for the overall quality of
                   an allocation which does not rely on numerical valuations
                   of the items. Instead, it captures the agents&#39; opinion
                   by a directed acyclic preference graph with vertices
                   representing items. An arc $(a,b)$ in such a graph means
                   that the agents prefer item $a$ over item $b$. For a given
                   allocation of items the dissatisfaction of an agent is
                   defined as the number of items which the agent does not
                   receive and for which no more preferred item is given to
                   the agent. Our goal is to find an efficient allocation of
                   the items to the agents such that the total dissatisfaction
                   over all agents is minimized. We explore the dichotomy
                   between NP-hard and polynomially solvable instances,
                   depending on properties of the underlying preference graph.
                   While the problem is NP-hard already for three agents even
                   on very restricted graph classes, it is polynomially
                   solvable for two agents on general preference graphs. For
                   an arbitrary number of agents, we derive polynomial-time
                   algorithms for relevant restrictions of the underlying
                   undirected graph. These are trees and, among the graphs of

  abstract     = {The Dial-a-Ride problem can contain various constraints
                  for pickup-delivery requests, such as time windows and ride
                  time constraints. Given a tour as a sequence of pickups and
                  deliveries, there exist polynomial time algorithms to find
                  a schedule respecting these constraints (provided that
                  there exists one). However, if no such schedule exists, it
                  is natural to ask for a schedule minimising constraint
                  violations. We model a generic fixed-sequence scheduling
                  problem, which we call Min Pickup-Delivery Scheduling, that
                  allows violation of time window constraints (by late
                  visits) and ride time constraints, both penalised with
                  linear penalty functions. Although our model only considers
                  these two types of time constraints, we show that it can
                  express other common time constraints such as earliness and
                  waiting times. We prove that Min Pickup-Delivery Scheduling
                  is APX-hard, even in the very restrictive case where only
                  the ride time constraints can be violated and the time
                  windows have the same length. Conversely, when only the
                  time window constraints can be violated (by late visits),
                  we present a polynomial time algorithm to solve the
                  problem. Then we focus on instances with some specific
                  structural properties and present two polynomial-time
                  algorithms: one for the case where all the ride time
                  constraints are bounded by a constant, and a second one for
                  the case where all the pickups precede all the deliveries

  abstract  = {The independence number of a tree decomposition is the
               maximum of the independence numbers of the subgraphs
               induced by its bags. The tree-independence number of a
               graph is the minimum independence number of a tree
               decomposition of it. Several NP-hard graph problems, like
               maximum weight independent set, can be solved in time
               $n^{O(k)}$ if the input graph is given with a tree
               decomposition of independence number at most $k$. However,
               it was an open problem if tree-independence number could be
               computed or approximated in $n^{f(k)}$ time, for some
               function $f$, and in particular it was not known if maximum
               weight independent set could be solved in polynomial time
               on graphs of bounded tree-independence number.
               
               In this paper, we resolve the main open problems about the
               computation of tree-independence number. First, we give an
               algorithm that given an $n$-vertex graph $G$ and an integer
               $k$, in time $2^{O(k^2)} n^{O(k)}$ either outputs a tree
               decomposition of $G$ with independence number at most $8k$,
               or determines that the tree-independence number of $G$ is
               larger than~$k$. This implies $2^{O(k^2)} n^{O(k)}$ time
               algorithms for various problems, like maximum weight
               independent set, parameterized by tree-independence number
               $k$ without needing the decomposition as an input. Then, we
               show that the exact computing of tree-independence number
               is paraNP-hard, in particular, that for every constant $k
               \ge 4$ it is NP-hard to decide if a given graph has
               tree-independence number at most $k$.},

                   clique, with the goal of understanding the extent to which
                   this property has useful algorithmic implications for the
                   Maximum Independent Set and related problems.
                   
                   In the previous paper of the series [Dallard, Milanič, and
                   Štorgel, Treewidth versus clique number. {II}.
                   Tree-independence number], we introduced the
                   \emph{tree-independence number}, a min-max graph invariant
                   related to tree decompositions. Bounded tree-independence
                   number implies both $(tw,\omega)$-boundedness and the
                   existence of a polynomial-time algorithm for the Maximum
                   Weight Independent Packing problem, provided that the input
                   graph is given together with a tree decomposition with
                   bounded independence number. In particular, this implies
                   polynomial-time solvability of the Maximum Weight
                   Independent Set problem.
                   
                   In this paper, we consider six graph containment
                   relations---the subgraph, topological minor, and minor
                   relations, as well as their induced variants---and for each
                   of them characterize the graphs $H$ for which any graph
                   excluding $H$ with respect to the relation admits a tree
                   decomposition with bounded independence number. The induced
                   minor relation is of particular interest: we show that
                   excluding either a $K_5$ minus an edge or the $4$-wheel
                   implies the existence of a tree decomposition in which
                   every bag is a clique plus at most $3$ vertices, while
                   excluding a complete bipartite graph $K_{2,q}$ implies the
                   existence of a tree decomposition with independence number
                   at most $2(q-1)$.
                   
                   These results are obtained using a variety of tools,
                   including $\ell$-refined tree decompositions, SPQR trees,
                   and potential maximal cliques, and actually show that in
                   the bounded cases identified in this work, one can also
                   compute tree decompositions with bounded independence
                   number efficiently. Applying the algorithmic framework
                   provided by the previous paper in the series leads to
                   polynomial-time algorithms for the Maximum Weight
                   Independent Set problem in an infinite family of graph
                   classes, each of which properly contains the class of

  abstract      = {In 2020, we initiated a systematic study of graph classes
                   in which the treewidth can only be large due to the
                   presence of a large clique, which we call
                   $(tw,\omega)$-bounded. The family of $(tw,\omega)$-bounded
                   graph classes provides a unifying framework for a variety
                   of very different families of graph classes, including
                   graph classes of bounded treewidth, graph classes of
                   bounded independence number, intersection graphs of
                   connected subgraphs of graphs with bounded treewidth, and
                   graphs in which all minimal separators are of bounded size.
                   While Chaplick and Zeman showed in 2017 that
                   $(tw,\omega)$-bounded graph classes enjoy some good
                   algorithmic properties related to clique and coloring
                   problems, it is an interesting open problem to which extent
                   $(tw,\omega)$-boundedness has useful algorithmic
                   implications for problems related to independent sets. We
                   provide a partial answer to this question by identifying a
                   sufficient condition for $(tw,\omega)$-bounded graph
                   classes to admit a polynomial-time algorithm for the
                   Maximum Weight Independent Packing problem and, as a
                   consequence, for the weighted variants of the Independent
                   Set and Induced Matching problems.
                   
                   Our approach is based on a new min-max graph parameter
                   related to tree decompositions. We define the
                   \emph{independence number} of a tree decomposition
                   $\mathcal{T}$ of a graph as the maximum independence number
                   over all subgraphs of $G$ induced by some bag of
                   $\mathcal{T}$. The \emph{tree-independence number} of a
                   graph $G$ is then defined as the minimum independence
                   number over all tree decompositions of $G$. Boundedness of
                   the tree-independence number is a refinement of
                   $(tw,\omega)$-boundedness that is still general enough to
                   hold for all the aforementioned families of graph classes.
                   Generalizing a result on chordal graphs due to Cameron and
                   Hell from 2006, we show that if a graph is given together
                   with a tree decomposition with bounded independence number,
                   then the Maximum Weight Independent Packing problem can be
                   solved in polynomial time. Applications of our general
                   algorithmic result to specific graph classes are given in
                   the third paper of the series [Dallard, Milanič, and

                   structure} in an undirected graph is a partition of its
                   vertex set into $k$ sets called \textit{communities}, each
                   of size at least two, such that every vertex of the graph
                   has proportionally at least as many neighbours in its own
                   community as in any other community. In this paper, we give
                   a necessary and sufficient condition for a forest on $n$
                   vertices to admit a $k$-community structure. Furthermore,
                   we provide an $\mathcal{O}(n^{2})$-time algorithm that
                   computes such a $k$-community structure in a forest, if it
                   exists. These results extend a result of [Bazgan et al.,

                   structure, Algorithmica, 80(6):1890-1908, 2018]. We also
                   show that if communities are allowed to have size one, then
                   every forest with $n \geq k\geq 2$ vertices admits a
                   $k$-community structure that can be found in time
                   $\mathcal{O}(n^{2})$. We then consider threshold graphs and
                   show that every connected threshold graph admits a
                   $2$-community structure if and only if it is not isomorphic
                   to a star; also if such a $2$-community structure exists,
                   we explain how to obtain it in linear time. We further
                   describe two infinite families of disconnected threshold
                   graphs, containing exactly one isolated vertex, that do not
                   admit any $2$-community structure. Finally, we present a
                   new infinite family of connected graphs that may contain an
                   even or an odd number of vertices without $2$-community

                  both structural and algorithmic reasons. A necessary
                  condition for a graph class to have bounded treewidth is
                  the absence of large cliques. We study graph classes closed

                  also sufficient, which we call $(tw,\omega)$-bounded. Such

                  applications related to variants of the clique and
                  $k$-coloring problems. We consider six well-known graph

                  subgraph, induced minor, induced topological minor, and
                  induced subgraph relations. For each of them, we give a
                  complete characterization of the graphs $H$ for which the

                  implications of $(tw,\omega)$-boundedness related to list

                  complexity of the problems on trees, we study both problems
                  on k-caterpillars, which are trees with a central path P
                  such that every vertex not in P is within distance k from a
                  vertex in P. We prove that Colourful Components and
                  Colourful Partition are NP-complete on 4-caterpillars with
                  maximum degree 3, 3-caterpillars with maximum degree 4 and
                  2-caterpillars with maximum degree 5. On the other hand, we
                  show that the problems are linear-time solvable on
                  1-caterpillars. Hence, our results imply two complexity
                  dichotomies on trees: Colourful Components and Colourful
                  Partition are linear-time solvable on trees with maximum
                  degree d if d≤2 (that is, on paths), and NP-complete
                  otherwise; Colourful Components and Colourful Partition are
                  linear-time solvable on k-caterpillars if k≤1, and
                  NP-complete otherwise. We leave three open cases which, if
                  solved, would provide a complexity dichotomy for both
                  problems on k-caterpillars, for every non-negative integer
                  k, with respect to the maximum degree. We also show that
                  Colourful Components is NP-complete on 5-coloured planar
                  graphs with maximum degree 4 and on 12-coloured planar
                  graphs with maximum degree 3. Our results answer two open
                  questions of Bulteau et al. mentioned in [30th Annual
                  Symposium on Combinatorial Pattern Matching, 2019].},

  abstract  = {A moplex is a natural graph structure that arises when
               lifting Dirac's classical theorem from chordal graphs to
               general graphs. The notion is known to be closely related
               to lexicographic searches in graphs as well as to
               asteroidal triples, and has been applied in several
               algorithms related to graph classes such as interval
               graphs, claw-free, and diamond-free graphs. However, while
               every non-complete graph has at least two moplexes, little
               is known about structural properties of graphs with a
               bounded number of moplexes. The study of these graphs is,
               in part, motivated by the parallel between moplexes in
               general graphs and simplicial modules in chordal graphs:
               unlike in the moplex setting, properties of chordal graphs
               with a bounded number of simplicial modules are well
               understood. For instance, chordal graphs having at most two
               simplicial modules are interval.
               
               In this work we initiate an investigation of $k$-moplex
               graphs, which are defined as graphs containing at most $k$
               moplexes. Of particular interest is the smallest nontrivial
               case $k=2$, which forms a counterpart to the class of
               interval graphs. As our main structural result, we show
               that, when restricted to connected graphs, the class of
               $2$-moplex graphs is sandwiched between the classes of
               proper interval graphs and cocomparability graphs;
               moreover, both inclusions are tight for hereditary classes.
               From a complexity theoretic viewpoint, this leads to the
               natural question of whether the presence of at most two
               moplexes guarantees a sufficient amount of structure to
               efficiently solve problems that are known to be intractable
               on cocomparability graphs, but not on proper interval
               graphs. We develop new reductions that answer this question
               negatively for two prominent problems fitting this profile,
               namely \textsc{Graph Isomorphism} and \textsc{Max-Cut}. On
               the other hand, we prove that every connected $2$-moplex
               graph contains a Hamiltonian path, generalising the same
               property of connected proper interval graphs. Furthermore,
               for graphs with a higher number of moplexes, we lift the
               previously known result that graphs without asteroidal

                  exists a sequence of $k$-sized independent sets in $G$,
                  $\langle S_0, S_1, \ldots, S_\ell \rangle$, such that for
                  every $i$, $|S_i| = k$, $S_i$ is an independent set, $S =
                  S_0$, $S_\ell = T$, and $|S_i \Delta S_{i+1}| = 2$. In
                  other words, if we view each independent set as a
                  collection of tokens placed on a subset of the vertices of
                  $G$, then the problem asks for a sequence of independent
                  sets which transforms $S$ to $T$ by individual token jumps
                  which maintain the independence of the sets. This problem
                  is known to be PSPACE-complete on very restricted graph
                  classes, e.g., planar bounded degree graphs and graphs of
                  bounded bandwidth. A closely related problem is the Token
                  Sliding problem, where instead of allowing a token to jump
                  to any vertex of the graph we instead require that a token
                  slides along an edge of the graph. Token Sliding is also
                  known to be PSPACE-complete on the aforementioned graph
                  classes. We investigate the parameterized complexity of
                  both problems on several graph classes, focusing on the
                  effect of excluding certain cycles from the input graph. In
                  particular, we show that both Token Sliding and Token
                  Jumping are fixed-parameter tractable on $C_4$-free
                  bipartite graphs when parameterized by $k$. For Token
                  Jumping, we in fact show that the problem admits a
                  polynomial kernel on $\{C_3,C_4\}$-free graphs. In the case

  abstract       = {Treewidth is an important graph invariant, relevant for
                    both structural and algorithmic reasons. A necessary
                    condition for a graph class to have bounded treewidth is
                    the absence of large cliques. We study graph classes in
                    which this condition is also sufficient, which we call
                    $(tw,\omega)$-bounded. Such graph classes are known to have
                    useful algorithmic applications related to variants of the
                    clique and $k$-coloring problems. We consider six
                    well-known graph containment relations: the minor,
                    topological minor, subgraph, induced minor, induced
                    topological minor, and induced subgraph relations. For each
                    of them, we give a complete characterization of the graphs
                    $H$ for which the class of graphs excluding $H$ is
                    $(tw,\omega)$-bounded. Our results imply that the class of
                    $1$-perfectly orientable graphs is $(tw,\omega)$-bounded,

  author         = {Chlebíková, Janka and Dallard, Clément},
  abstract       = { A connected component of a vertex-coloured graph is said
                    to be \emph{colourful} if all its vertices have different
                    colours, and a graph is colourful if all its connected
                    components are colourful. Given a vertex-coloured graph,
                    the \textsc{Colourful Components} problem asks whether
                    there exist at most $p$ edges whose removal makes the graph
                    colourful, and the \textsc{Colourful Partition} problem
                    asks whether there exists a partition of the vertex set
                    with at most $p$ parts such that each part induces a
                    colourful component. We study the problems on
                    $k$-caterpillars (caterpillars with hairs of length at most
                    $k$) and explore the boundary between polynomial and
                    NP-complete cases. It is known that the problems are
                    NP-complete on $2$-caterpillars with unbounded maximum
                    degree. We prove that both problems remain NP-complete on
                    binary $4$-caterpillars and on ternary $3$-caterpillars.
                    This answers an open question regarding the complexity of
                    the problems on trees with maximum degree at most $5$. On
                    the positive side, we give a linear time algorithm for
                    $1$-caterpillars with unbounded degree, even if the
                    backbone is a cycle, which outperforms the previous best
                    complexity for paths and widens the class of graphs.
                    Finally, we answer an open question regarding the
                    complexity of \textsc{Colourful Components} on graphs with
                    maximum degree at most $5$. We show that the problem is
                    NP-complete on $5$-coloured planar graphs with maximum
                    degree $4$, and on $12$-coloured planar graphs with maximum
                    degree $3$. Since the problem can be solved in
                    polynomial-time on graphs with maximum degree $2$, the
                    results are the best possible with regard to the maximum
                    degree.},

                    for pickup-delivery requests, such as time windows and ride
                    time constraints. For a tour, given as a sequence of pickup
                    and delivery stops, there exist polynomial time algorithms
                    to find a schedule respecting these constraints, provided
                    that there exists one. However, if no feasible schedule
                    exists, the natural question is to find a schedule
                    minimising constraint violations. We model a generic

                    ride time violations with linear penalty functions and

                    to a polynomial time algorithm if only the time window
                    constraints can be violated (by late visits). Then, we show
                    that the problem can be solved in polynomial time if all
                    the ride time constraints are bounded by a constant.

                    to complete the contig assembly process by determining the

                    as a combinatorial optimization problem in a graph named

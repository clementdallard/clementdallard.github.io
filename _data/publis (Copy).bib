abstract = {The independence number of a tree decomposition is the maximum of the independence numbers of the subgraphs induced by its bags. The tree-independence number of a graph is the minimum independence number of a tree decomposition of it. Several NP-hard graph problems, like maximum weight independent set, can be solved in time $n^{\mathcal{O}(k)})$ if the input $n$-vertex graph is given together with a tree decomposition of independence number $k$ . Yolov, in [SODA 2018], gave an algorithm that, given an $n$-vertex graph $G$ and an integer $k$, in time $n^{\mathcal{O}(k^{3})}$ either constructs a tree decomposition of $G$ whose independence number is $\mathcal{O}(k^{3})$ or correctly reports that the tree-independence number of $G$ is larger than $k$. In this paper, we first give an algorithm for computing the tree-independence number with a better approximation ratio and running time and then prove that our algorithm is, in some sense, the best one can hope for. More precisely, our algorithm runs in time $2^{\mathcal{O}(k^{2})}n^{\mathcal{O}(k)}$ and either outputs a tree decomposition of $G$ with independence number at most $8k$, or determines that the tree-independence number of $G$ is larger than $k$. This implies $2^{\mathcal{O}(k^{2})}n^{\mathcal{O}(k)}$-time algorithms for various problems, like maximum weight independent set, parameterized by the tree-independence number $k$ without needing the decomposition as an input. Assuming Gap-ETH, an $n^{\Omega(k)}$ factor in the running time is unavoidable for any approximation algorithm for the tree-independence number. Our second result is that the exact computation of the tree-independence number is para-NP-hard: We show that for every constant $k \geq 4$ it is NP-complete to decide if a given graph has the tree-independence number at most $k$.},

      abstract={Motivated by a question of Galby, Munaro, and Yang (SoCG 2023) asking whether every graph class of bounded layered tree-independence number admits clique-based separators of sublinear weight, we investigate relations between layered tree-independence number, weight of clique-based separators, clique cover degeneracy and independence degeneracy. In particular, we provide a number of results bounding these parameters on geometric intersection graphs. For example, we show that the layered tree-independence number is $\mathcal{O}(g)$ for $g$-map graphs, $\mathcal{O}(\frac{r}{\tanh r})$ for hyperbolic uniform disk graphs with radius $r$, and $\mathcal{O}(1)$ for spherical uniform disk graphs with radius $r$. Our structural results have algorithmic consequences. In particular, we obtain a number of subexponential or quasi-polynomial-time algorithms for weighted problems such as \textsc{Max Weight Independent Set} and \textsc{Min Weight Feedback Vertex Set} on several geometric intersection graphs. Finally, we conjecture that every fractionally tree-independence-number-fragile graph class has bounded independence degeneracy.}

      abstract={A graph $H$ is said to be an \emph{induced minor} of a graph $G$ if $H$ can be obtained from $G$ by a sequence of vertex deletions and edge contractions.
  Equivalently, $H$ is an induced minor of $G$ if there exists an \emph{induced minor model} of $H$ in $G$, that is, a collection of pairwise disjoint subsets of vertices of $G$ labeled by the vertices of $H$, each inducing a connected subgraph in $G$, such that two vertices of $H$ are adjacent if and only if there is an edge in $G$ between the corresponding subsets.

  In this paper, we investigate structural properties of induced minor models, including bounds on treewidth and chromatic number of the subgraphs induced by minimal induced minor models.
  It is known that for some graphs $H$, testing a given graph $G$ contains $H$ as an induced minor is an NP-complete problem.
  Nevertheless, as algorithmic applications of our structural results, we make use of recent developments regarding tree-independence number to show that if $H$ is the $4$-wheel, the $5$-vertex complete graph minus an edge, or a complete bipartite graph $K_{2,q}$, then there is a polynomial-time algorithm to find in a given graph $G$ an induced minor model of $H$ in $G$, if there is one.
  We also develop an alternative polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing graphs that do not contain $K_{2,3}$ as an induced minor, which revolves around the idea of detecting the induced subgraphs whose presence is forced when the input graph contains $K_{2,3}$ as an induced minor, using the so-called shortest path detector.
  It turns out that all these induced subgraphs are Truemper configurations.}

Several graphs $H$ are known for which $H$-IMC is NP-complete, even when $H$ is a tree. In this paper, we investigate which conditions on $H$ and $G$ are sufficient so that the problem becomes polynomial-time solvable. Our results identify three infinite classes of graphs such that, if $H$ belongs to one of these classes, then $H$-IMC can be solved in polynomial time. Moreover, we show that if the input graph $G$ excludes long induced paths, then $H$-IMC is polynomial-time solvable for any fixed graph $H$. As a byproduct of our results, this implies that $H$-IMC is polynomial-time solvable for all graphs $H$ with at most 5 vertices, except for three open cases.},

                   by a directed acyclic preference graph with vertices
                   representing items. An arc $(a,b)$ in such a graph means
                   that the agents prefer item $a$ over item $b$. For a given
                   allocation of items the dissatisfaction of an agent is

                  a schedule respecting these constraints (provided that

  abstract  = {The independence number of a tree decomposition is the
               maximum of the independence numbers of the subgraphs
               induced by its bags. The tree-independence number of a
               graph is the minimum independence number of a tree
               decomposition of it. Several NP-hard graph problems, like
               maximum weight independent set, can be solved in time
               $n^{O(k)}$ if the input graph is given with a tree
               decomposition of independence number at most $k$. However,
               it was an open problem if tree-independence number could be
               computed or approximated in $n^{f(k)}$ time, for some
               function $f$, and in particular it was not known if maximum
               weight independent set could be solved in polynomial time
               on graphs of bounded tree-independence number.
               
               In this paper, we resolve the main open problems about the
               computation of tree-independence number. First, we give an
               algorithm that given an $n$-vertex graph $G$ and an integer
               $k$, in time $2^{O(k^2)} n^{O(k)}$ either outputs a tree
               decomposition of $G$ with independence number at most $8k$,
               or determines that the tree-independence number of $G$ is
               larger than~$k$. This implies $2^{O(k^2)} n^{O(k)}$ time
               algorithms for various problems, like maximum weight
               independent set, parameterized by tree-independence number
               $k$ without needing the decomposition as an input. Then, we
               show that the exact computing of tree-independence number
               is paraNP-hard, in particular, that for every constant $k
               \ge 4$ it is NP-hard to decide if a given graph has
               tree-independence number at most $k$.},

                   this property has useful algorithmic implications for the
                   Maximum Independent Set and related problems.
                   
                   In the previous paper of the series [Dallard, Milanič, and
                   Štorgel, Treewidth versus clique number. {II}.
                   Tree-independence number], we introduced the
                   \emph{tree-independence number}, a min-max graph invariant
                   related to tree decompositions. Bounded tree-independence
                   number implies both $(tw,\omega)$-boundedness and the
                   existence of a polynomial-time algorithm for the Maximum
                   Weight Independent Packing problem, provided that the input
                   graph is given together with a tree decomposition with
                   bounded independence number. In particular, this implies
                   polynomial-time solvability of the Maximum Weight
                   Independent Set problem.
                   
                   In this paper, we consider six graph containment
                   relations---the subgraph, topological minor, and minor
                   relations, as well as their induced variants---and for each
                   of them characterize the graphs $H$ for which any graph
                   excluding $H$ with respect to the relation admits a tree
                   decomposition with bounded independence number. The induced
                   minor relation is of particular interest: we show that
                   excluding either a $K_5$ minus an edge or the $4$-wheel
                   implies the existence of a tree decomposition in which
                   every bag is a clique plus at most $3$ vertices, while
                   excluding a complete bipartite graph $K_{2,q}$ implies the
                   existence of a tree decomposition with independence number
                   at most $2(q-1)$.
                   
                   These results are obtained using a variety of tools,
                   including $\ell$-refined tree decompositions, SPQR trees,
                   and potential maximal cliques, and actually show that in
                   the bounded cases identified in this work, one can also
                   compute tree decompositions with bounded independence
                   number efficiently. Applying the algorithmic framework
                   provided by the previous paper in the series leads to
                   polynomial-time algorithms for the Maximum Weight
                   Independent Set problem in an infinite family of graph
                   classes, each of which properly contains the class of
                   chordal graphs. In particular, these results apply to the
                   class of $1$-perfectly orientable graphs, answering a
                   question of Beisegel, Chudnovsky, Gurvich, Milani\v c, and

  abstract      = {In 2020, we initiated a systematic study of graph classes
                   in which the treewidth can only be large due to the
                   presence of a large clique, which we call
                   $(tw,\omega)$-bounded. The family of $(tw,\omega)$-bounded
                   graph classes provides a unifying framework for a variety
                   of very different families of graph classes, including
                   graph classes of bounded treewidth, graph classes of
                   bounded independence number, intersection graphs of
                   connected subgraphs of graphs with bounded treewidth, and
                   graphs in which all minimal separators are of bounded size.
                   While Chaplick and Zeman showed in 2017 that
                   $(tw,\omega)$-bounded graph classes enjoy some good
                   algorithmic properties related to clique and coloring
                   problems, it is an interesting open problem to which extent
                   $(tw,\omega)$-boundedness has useful algorithmic
                   implications for problems related to independent sets. We
                   provide a partial answer to this question by identifying a
                   sufficient condition for $(tw,\omega)$-bounded graph
                   classes to admit a polynomial-time algorithm for the
                   Maximum Weight Independent Packing problem and, as a
                   consequence, for the weighted variants of the Independent
                   Set and Induced Matching problems.
                   
                   Our approach is based on a new min-max graph parameter
                   related to tree decompositions. We define the
                   \emph{independence number} of a tree decomposition
                   $\mathcal{T}$ of a graph as the maximum independence number
                   over all subgraphs of $G$ induced by some bag of
                   $\mathcal{T}$. The \emph{tree-independence number} of a
                   graph $G$ is then defined as the minimum independence
                   number over all tree decompositions of $G$. Boundedness of
                   the tree-independence number is a refinement of
                   $(tw,\omega)$-boundedness that is still general enough to
                   hold for all the aforementioned families of graph classes.
                   Generalizing a result on chordal graphs due to Cameron and
                   Hell from 2006, we show that if a graph is given together
                   with a tree decomposition with bounded independence number,
                   then the Maximum Weight Independent Packing problem can be
                   solved in polynomial time. Applications of our general
                   algorithmic result to specific graph classes are given in

  abstract      = { For a fixed integer $k\ge 2$, a \emph{$k$-community
                   structure} in an undirected graph is a partition of its
                   vertex set into $k$ sets called \textit{communities}, each
                   of size at least two, such that every vertex of the graph
                   has proportionally at least as many neighbours in its own
                   community as in any other community. In this paper, we give
                   a necessary and sufficient condition for a forest on $n$
                   vertices to admit a $k$-community structure. Furthermore,
                   we provide an $\mathcal{O}(n^{2})$-time algorithm that
                   computes such a $k$-community structure in a forest, if it
                   exists. These results extend a result of [Bazgan et al.,
                   Structural and algorithmic properties of $2$-community
                   structure, Algorithmica, 80(6):1890-1908, 2018]. We also
                   show that if communities are allowed to have size one, then
                   every forest with $n \geq k\geq 2$ vertices admits a
                   $k$-community structure that can be found in time
                   $\mathcal{O}(n^{2})$. We then consider threshold graphs and
                   show that every connected threshold graph admits a
                   $2$-community structure if and only if it is not isomorphic
                   to a star; also if such a $2$-community structure exists,
                   we explain how to obtain it in linear time. We further
                   describe two infinite families of disconnected threshold
                   graphs, containing exactly one isolated vertex, that do not
                   admit any $2$-community structure. Finally, we present a
                   new infinite family of connected graphs that may contain an
                   even or an odd number of vertices without $2$-community

  abstract     = {Treewidth is an important graph invariant, relevant for
                  both structural and algorithmic reasons. A necessary
                  condition for a graph class to have bounded treewidth is
                  the absence of large cliques. We study graph classes closed
                  under taking induced subgraphs in which this condition is
                  also sufficient, which we call $(tw,\omega)$-bounded. Such
                  graph classes are known to have useful algorithmic
                  applications related to variants of the clique and
                  $k$-coloring problems. We consider six well-known graph
                  containment relations: the minor, topological minor,
                  subgraph, induced minor, induced topological minor, and
                  induced subgraph relations. For each of them, we give a
                  complete characterization of the graphs $H$ for which the
                  class of graphs excluding $H$ is $(tw,\omega)$-bounded. Our
                  results yield an infinite family of $\chi$-bounded
                  induced-minor-closed graph classes and imply that the class
                  of $1$-perfectly orientable graphs is
                  $(tw,\omega)$-bounded, leading to linear-time algorithms
                  for $k$-coloring $1$-perfectly orientable graphs for every
                  fixed $k$. This answers a question of Brešar, Hartinger,
                  Kos, and Milanič from 2018, and one of Beisegel,
                  Chudnovsky, Gurvich, Milanič, and Servatius from 2019,
                  respectively. We also reveal some further algorithmic
                  implications of $(tw,\omega)$-boundedness related to list
                  $k$-coloring and clique problems. In addition, we propose a
                  question about the complexity of the Maximum Weight
                  Independent Set problem in $(tw,\omega)$-bounded graph
                  classes and prove that the problem is polynomial-time
                  solvable in every class of graphs excluding a fixed star as
                  an induced minor.},

  title        = {Colourful components in k-caterpillars and planar graphs},
  author       = {Chlebíková, Janka and Dallard, Clément},
  abstract     = {A connected component of a vertex-coloured graph is said
                  to be colourful if all its vertices have different colours.
                  By extension, a graph is colourful if all its connected
                  components are colourful. Given a vertex-coloured graph G
                  and an integer p, the Colourful Components problem asks
                  whether there exist at most p edges whose removal makes G
                  colourful and the Colourful Partition problem asks whether
                  there exists a partition of G into at most p colourful
                  components. In order to refine our understanding of the
                  complexity of the problems on trees, we study both problems
                  on k-caterpillars, which are trees with a central path P
                  such that every vertex not in P is within distance k from a
                  vertex in P. We prove that Colourful Components and
                  Colourful Partition are NP-complete on 4-caterpillars with
                  maximum degree 3, 3-caterpillars with maximum degree 4 and
                  2-caterpillars with maximum degree 5. On the other hand, we
                  show that the problems are linear-time solvable on
                  1-caterpillars. Hence, our results imply two complexity
                  dichotomies on trees: Colourful Components and Colourful
                  Partition are linear-time solvable on trees with maximum
                  degree d if d≤2 (that is, on paths), and NP-complete
                  otherwise; Colourful Components and Colourful Partition are
                  linear-time solvable on k-caterpillars if k≤1, and
                  NP-complete otherwise. We leave three open cases which, if
                  solved, would provide a complexity dichotomy for both
                  problems on k-caterpillars, for every non-negative integer
                  k, with respect to the maximum degree. We also show that
                  Colourful Components is NP-complete on 5-coloured planar
                  graphs with maximum degree 4 and on 12-coloured planar
                  graphs with maximum degree 3. Our results answer two open

  abstract  = {A moplex is a natural graph structure that arises when
               lifting Dirac's classical theorem from chordal graphs to
               general graphs. The notion is known to be closely related
               to lexicographic searches in graphs as well as to
               asteroidal triples, and has been applied in several
               algorithms related to graph classes such as interval
               graphs, claw-free, and diamond-free graphs. However, while
               every non-complete graph has at least two moplexes, little
               is known about structural properties of graphs with a
               bounded number of moplexes. The study of these graphs is,
               in part, motivated by the parallel between moplexes in
               general graphs and simplicial modules in chordal graphs:
               unlike in the moplex setting, properties of chordal graphs
               with a bounded number of simplicial modules are well
               understood. For instance, chordal graphs having at most two
               simplicial modules are interval.
               
               In this work we initiate an investigation of $k$-moplex
               graphs, which are defined as graphs containing at most $k$
               moplexes. Of particular interest is the smallest nontrivial
               case $k=2$, which forms a counterpart to the class of
               interval graphs. As our main structural result, we show
               that, when restricted to connected graphs, the class of
               $2$-moplex graphs is sandwiched between the classes of
               proper interval graphs and cocomparability graphs;
               moreover, both inclusions are tight for hereditary classes.
               From a complexity theoretic viewpoint, this leads to the
               natural question of whether the presence of at most two
               moplexes guarantees a sufficient amount of structure to
               efficiently solve problems that are known to be intractable
               on cocomparability graphs, but not on proper interval
               graphs. We develop new reductions that answer this question
               negatively for two prominent problems fitting this profile,

               the other hand, we prove that every connected $2$-moplex

  abstract     = {In the Token Jumping problem we are given a graph $G =
                 $V,E)$ and two independent sets $S$ and $T$ of $G$, each of
                  size $k \geq 1$. The goal is to determine whether there
                  exists a sequence of $k$-sized independent sets in $G$,
                  $\langle S_0, S_1, \ldots, S_\ell \rangle$, such that for
                  every $i$, $|S_i| = k$, $S_i$ is an independent set, $S =
                  S_0$, $S_\ell = T$, and $|S_i \Delta S_{i+1}| = 2$. In
                  other words, if we view each independent set as a
                  collection of tokens placed on a subset of the vertices of
                  $G$, then the problem asks for a sequence of independent
                  sets which transforms $S$ to $T$ by individual token jumps
                  which maintain the independence of the sets. This problem
                  is known to be PSPACE-complete on very restricted graph
                  classes, e.g., planar bounded degree graphs and graphs of
                  bounded bandwidth. A closely related problem is the Token
                  Sliding problem, where instead of allowing a token to jump
                  to any vertex of the graph we instead require that a token
                  slides along an edge of the graph. Token Sliding is also
                  known to be PSPACE-complete on the aforementioned graph
                  classes. We investigate the parameterized complexity of
                  both problems on several graph classes, focusing on the
                  effect of excluding certain cycles from the input graph. In
                  particular, we show that both Token Sliding and Token
                  Jumping are fixed-parameter tractable on $C_4$-free
                  bipartite graphs when parameterized by $k$. For Token
                  Jumping, we in fact show that the problem admits a
                  polynomial kernel on $\{C_3,C_4\}$-free graphs. In the case
                  of Token Sliding, we also show that the problem admits a
                  polynomial kernel on bipartite graphs of bounded degree. We
                  believe both of these results to be of independent
                  interest. We complement these positive results by showing
                  that, for any constant $p \geq 4$, both problems are
                  W[1]-hard on $\{C_4, \dots, C_p\}$-free graphs and Token
                  Sliding remains W[1]-hard even on bipartite graphs.},

                    Clément and Lomer, Kyle and Mouawad, Amer E},
  abstract       = {In the \textsc{Token Jumping} problem we are given a graph
                    $G = (V,E)$ and two independent sets $S$ and $T$ of $G$,
                    each of size $k \geq 1$. The goal is to determine whether
                    there exists a sequence of $k$-sized independent sets in
                    $G$, $\langle S_0, S_1, \ldots, S_\ell \rangle$, such that
                    for every $i$, $|S_i| = k$, $S_i$ is an independent set, $S
                    = S_0$, $S_\ell = T$, and $|S_i \Delta S_{i+1}| = 2$. In
                    other words, if we view each independent set as a
                    collection of tokens placed on a subset of the vertices of
                    $G$, then the problem asks for a sequence of independent
                    sets which transforms $S$ to $T$ by individual token jumps
                    which maintain the independence of the sets. This problem
                    is known to be PSPACE-complete on very restricted graph
                    classes, e.g., planar bounded degree graphs and graphs of
                    bounded bandwidth. A closely related problem is the
                    \textsc{Token Sliding} problem, where instead of allowing a
                    token to jump to any vertex of the graph we instead require
                    that a token slides along an edge of the graph.
                    \textsc{Token Sliding} is also known to be PSPACE-complete
                    on the aforementioned graph classes. We investigate the
                    parameterized complexity of both problems on several graph
                    classes, focusing on the effect of excluding certain cycles
                    from the input graph. In particular, we show that both
                    \textsc{Token Sliding} and \textsc{Token Jumping} are
                    fixed-parameter tractable on $C_4$-free bipartite graphs
                    when parameterized by $k$. For \textsc{Token Jumping}, we
                    in fact show that the problem admits a polynomial kernel on
                    $\{C_3,C_4\}$-free graphs. In the case of \textsc{Token
                    Sliding}, we also show that the problem admits a polynomial
                    kernel on bipartite graphs of bounded degree. We believe
                    both of these results to be of independent interest. We
                    complement these positive results by showing that, for any
                    constant $p \geq 4$, both problems are W[1]-hard on $\{C_4,
                    \dots, C_p\}$-free graphs and \textsc{Token Sliding}
                    remains W[1]-hard even on bipartite graphs.},

                    condition for a graph class to have bounded treewidth is
                    the absence of large cliques. We study graph classes in

                    useful algorithmic applications related to variants of the

                    topological minor, subgraph, induced minor, induced

  author         = {Chlebíková, Janka and Dallard, Clément},
  abstract       = { A connected component of a vertex-coloured graph is said
                    to be \emph{colourful} if all its vertices have different
                    colours, and a graph is colourful if all its connected
                    components are colourful. Given a vertex-coloured graph,
                    the \textsc{Colourful Components} problem asks whether
                    there exist at most $p$ edges whose removal makes the graph
                    colourful, and the \textsc{Colourful Partition} problem
                    asks whether there exists a partition of the vertex set
                    with at most $p$ parts such that each part induces a
                    colourful component. We study the problems on
                    $k$-caterpillars (caterpillars with hairs of length at most
                    $k$) and explore the boundary between polynomial and
                    NP-complete cases. It is known that the problems are
                    NP-complete on $2$-caterpillars with unbounded maximum
                    degree. We prove that both problems remain NP-complete on
                    binary $4$-caterpillars and on ternary $3$-caterpillars.
                    This answers an open question regarding the complexity of
                    the problems on trees with maximum degree at most $5$. On
                    the positive side, we give a linear time algorithm for
                    $1$-caterpillars with unbounded degree, even if the
                    backbone is a cycle, which outperforms the previous best
                    complexity for paths and widens the class of graphs.
                    Finally, we answer an open question regarding the
                    complexity of \textsc{Colourful Components} on graphs with
                    maximum degree at most $5$. We show that the problem is
                    NP-complete on $5$-coloured planar graphs with maximum
                    degree $4$, and on $12$-coloured planar graphs with maximum
                    degree $3$. Since the problem can be solved in
                    polynomial-time on graphs with maximum degree $2$, the
                    results are the best possible with regard to the maximum

                    to find a schedule respecting these constraints, provided

                    to complete the contig assembly process by determining the

                    as a combinatorial optimization problem in a graph named
                    scaffold graph, this problem is NP-hard and its exact
                    resolution is generally impossible on large instances.
                    Hence, heuristics like polynomial-time approximation
                    algorithms remain the only possibility to propose a
                    solution. In general, even in the case where we know a

                    experiments on real instances and show that the greedy
                    algorithm yields near from optimal solutions.},
